# Feed Reader Testing

Jasmine (v2.1.2) Test Suite for a web-based application that reads RSS feeds.

## Dependencies

### Repo files
- `dist` folder containing production-ready `index.html`, css, fonts, jS, and jasmine files (all generated by task runner when changes to dev files are made)
- `dev` folder containing development version of all files listed above
- `gulpfile.js` file containing tasks for generating the set of `dist` files from `dev` files when changes are made
- `package.json` file containing list of babel, eslint, and gulp dependencies
- `README.md` file

### Dev
- Node.js and the Node Package Manager must be installed (v6.10.1 Node.js used)
- Dependencies must be installed by running `npm install`
  

## How to run the application
1. Clone this repo
2. Open `dist/index.html` file in the browser. 

NOTE: Opening `dev/index.html` will *not* successfully run the application, since referenced stylesheets and scripts are from generated files within the `dist` folder.

## How to run the Jasmine test suite
1. Clone this repo
2. Open `dist/index.html` file in the browser. Jasmine test results will appear at the bottom of the page in the browser.

## Editing the Jasmine test suite
1. Clone this repo
2. Make and save any changes to `dev/jasmine/spec/feedrunner.js` file
3. Run `gulp copy-jasmine` to copy changes to `dist/jasmine` files

## Editing the application
1. Clone this repo
2. Make changes to files in the `dev` folder
3. Use Gulp to generate new `dist` files when changes are made:

- Run `gulp` (default task) in CLI before making any changes to automatically generate new `dist` files as changes to `dev` files are saved, and it will continue to watch for changes
    
    OR

- Run the `gulp dist` task in CLI to generate new set of dist files once all changes to `dev` files have been saved and you are ready to update `dist`.

### Individual Gulp tasks
Gulp tasks for watching and/or copying changes made to individual files can be found in `gulpfile.js`, including:
- `copy-html` and `checking-html`
- `copy-styles` and `checking-styles`
- `copy-fonts` and `checking-fonts`
- `copy-scripts` and `checking-scripts` (for scripts in the `js` folder)
- `copy-jasmine` (for all files in `jasmine` folder)
- `checking-jasmine-spec` and `lint-jasmine-spec` (for `jasmine/spec/feedrunner.js`)
- while the app currently has no images, a `copy-imgs` task is provided if images are added to the repo to a `dev/imgs` folder
